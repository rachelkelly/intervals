# intervals
running intervals

I want a running app on Android which will do the following:
- -let user set length of intervals- **DONE**
- -let user set number of intervals- **DONE**
- -let user set length of walking breaks- **DONE**
- -set these loose in a while loop that runs down the number of intervals- **DONE**
- tells user when to run & when to walk with Text-To-Speech
- Beeps (how to load a sound file into beeware android app)
- extremely EXTREMELY light UI.
-- Welcome page
-- Different screen during run
--- with countdown?

As of 3cfc3cb, I have the complete android app scaffolding in place, as well as the values in place to start setting up logic for the while loop.  This will require familiarity with Toga's text display functionality. 


Far-future self reminders:
* Need to get approved as developer on google play store
* Need to advise user somehow to turn off Battery Monitoring so it can run in the background
